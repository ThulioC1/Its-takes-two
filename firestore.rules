     * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a "Couple Membership" security model
     * based on a user's profile document in the `/users` collection.
     * All data is strictly segregated by a unique `coupleId`. A user can only
     * access data under a `/couples/{coupleId}` path if their own user profile
     * at `/users/{request.auth.uid}` contains a matching `coupleId` field.
     *
     * Data Structure: All application data is organized into subcollections under a
     * top-level `/couples/{coupleId}` document. User profiles are stored in a separate
     * top-level `/users` collection.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * - Authorization via Profile Document: Access is determined by a `get()` call
     *   to the user's own profile. This is secure and allows for flexible couple
     *   management. While `get()` calls have a performance cost, they are necessary
     *   for this relational security model and are scoped to a single document read
     *   per protected operation.
     * - No Public Data: There are no publicly readable collections. All access
     *   requires a user to be signed in.
     * - User Profile Security: Users can only create their own profile, read their
     *   own profile, and can only update their own coupleId if they are part of the
     *   same couple (to allow joining/leaving).
